Pa11y Dashboard
===============

Pa11y Dashboard is a web interface to the [Pa11y][pa11y] accessibility reporter; allowing you to focus on *fixing* issues rather than hunting them down.

Setup
-----

Pa11y Dashboard requires [Node.js][node] 4+. See the [Pa11y][pa11y] documentation for detailed instructions on how to install this on your operating system.

You'll also need to have [MongoDB][mongo] installed and running. See the [MongoDB install guide][mongo-install] for more information on this.

You'll then need to clone this repo locally and install dependencies with `npm install`. Now you need to add some configuration before you can run the application. We can do this in two ways:

### Option 1: Using Environment Variables

Each configuration can be set with an environment variable rather than a config file. For example to run the application on port `8080` you can use the following:

```sh
PORT=8080 node index.js
```

The [available configurations are documented here](#configurations).

### Option 2: Using Config Files

You'll need to copy and modify different config files depending on your environment (set with `NODE_ENV`):

```sh
cp config/development.sample.json config/development.json
cp config/production.sample.json config/production.json
cp config/test.sample.json config/test.json
```

Each of these files defines configurations for a different environment. If you're just running the application locally, then you should be OK with just development and test configurations. The [available configurations are documented here](#configurations).

Now that you've got your application configured, make sure you have a MongoDB server running with the `mongod` command in another terminal window. You can run in each mode by changing the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development node index.js
```

See [development instructions](#development) for more information about running locally (and restarting automatically when files change).

If you run into problems, check the [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting].


Configurations
--------------

The boot configurations for Pa11y Dashboard are as follows. Look at the sample JSON files in the repo for example usage.

### port
*(number)* The port to run the application on. Set via a config file or the `PORT` environment variable.

### noindex
*(boolean)* If set to `true` (default), the dashboard will not be indexed by search engines. Set to `false` to allow indexing. Set via a config file or the `NOINDEX` environment variable.

### readonly
*(boolean)* If set to `true`, users will not be able to add, delete or run URLs (defaults to `false`). Set via a config file or the `READONLY` environment variable.

### siteMessage
*(string)* A message to display prominently on the site home page. Defaults to `null`.

### webservice
This can either be an object containing [Pa11y Webservice configurations][pa11y-webservice-config], or a string which is the base URL of a [Pa11y Webservice][pa11y-webservice] instance you are running separately. If using environment variables, prefix the webservice vars with `WEBSERVICE_`.


Contributing
------------

There are many ways to contribute to Pa11y Dashboard, we cover these in the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for this repo.

If you're ready to contribute some code, you'll need to clone the repo and get set up as outlined in the [setup guide](#setup). You'll then need to start the application in test mode with:

```sh
NODE_ENV=test node index.js
```

You'll now be able to run the following commands:

```sh
make verify              # Verify all of the code (ESLint)
make test                # Run all tests
make test-integration    # Run the integration tests
```

To compile the client-side JavaScript and CSS, you'll need the following commands. Compiled code is committed to the repository.

```sh
make less    # Compile the site CSS from LESS files
make uglify  # Compile and uglify the client-side JavaScript
```

Support and Migration
---------------------

Pa11y Dashboard major versions are normally supported for 6 months after their last minor release. This means that patch-level changes will be added and bugs will be fixed. The table below outlines the end-of-support dates for major versions, and the last minor release for that version.

We also maintain a [migration guide](MIGRATION.md) to help you migrate.

| :grey_question: | Major Version | Last Minor Release | Node.js Versions | Support End Date |
